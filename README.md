# PlanB
PlanB is a game about two men fishing, but they did bring any lure.
So one of the players is swimming in the water as lure trying to grab a juicy fish.
The other player tries to keep the player safe by adjusting height and has to keep birds away from the boat.
The goal is to get as many big fishes as possible, sell them for a huge profit and buy better equipment to venture deeper.
